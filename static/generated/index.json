    "prompt": "A wide-angle, documentary-style photograph inside a state-of-the-art research facility, showing diverse scientists and engineers in cleanroom attire collaborating near sophisticated industrial machinery. The scene is illuminated by cool fluorescent and warm task lighting, with subtle violet and azure accents reflected in safety gear and equipment surfaces. The composition uses layered depth: people are in the midground, surrounded by technical infrastructure, with clean metallic tones dominating and deliberate negative space for clarity. The mood is one of quiet intensity and approachable professionalism, as experts concentrate on hands-on adjustments and collaborative problem-solving. The lighting preserves deep shadows and bright highlights, emphasizing the scale and complexity of the environment, with a high dynamic range. No screens, text, posters, or abstract elements are present—only real people, equipment, and the organized precision of an elite research facility.",

    "prompt": "A wide-angle, documentary-style photograph of a diverse team of scientists and engineers working together in a spacious, high-tech industrial laboratory. The scene is bathed in cool fluorescent and warm task lighting, with subtle violet and azure accents visible on safety gear and equipment. The composition uses layered depth: people are in the midground, deeply focused on hands-on tasks and collaborative problem-solving, with complex machinery and laboratory infrastructure in the foreground and background. Negative space from clean walls and uncluttered work surfaces adds breathing room. The mood is quietly intense, showing calm expertise and approachable professionalism. The color palette is mostly neutral grays and metallics, with branded violet and azure highlights emerging naturally from the environment. No screens, text, or abstract elements are present. Shot in 16:9, with sharp focus on the team and subtle depth-of-field to reveal the facility's scale and sophistication.",
