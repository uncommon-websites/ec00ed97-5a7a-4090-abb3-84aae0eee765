    "prompt": "A wide-angle, documentary-style photograph inside a state-of-the-art research facility, showing diverse scientists and engineers in cleanroom attire collaborating near sophisticated industrial machinery. The scene is illuminated by cool fluorescent and warm task lighting, with subtle violet and azure accents reflected in safety gear and equipment surfaces. The composition uses layered depth: people are in the midground, surrounded by technical infrastructure, with clean metallic tones dominating and deliberate negative space for clarity. The mood is one of quiet intensity and approachable professionalism, as experts concentrate on hands-on adjustments and collaborative problem-solving. The lighting preserves deep shadows and bright highlights, emphasizing the scale and complexity of the environment, with a high dynamic range. No screens, text, posters, or abstract elements are present—only real people, equipment, and the organized precision of an elite research facility.",
